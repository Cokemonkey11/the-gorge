[R][H3][color=#CCAA00]Introduction[/color][/H3][R]
The Gorge is a battleships-style aos that focuses on simplicity. It uses
automatically firing weapons and interesting systems to produce a design         that's
nostalgic yet fun.

The western nations and eatern faction have long been allies and shared         knowledge,
as well as technology; but the recent discoery of numerous         rich resource deposits
near an unnamed gorge has resulted in a bitter         standoff. Secure your team's
victory in one final cacophony of         helicopters, explosives, and other armament.

[R][H3][color=#CCAA00]Introduction[/color][/H3][R]
Battle Planes is a battleships-style AoS/MOBA that focuses on simplicity.         It uses
automatically firing weapons, and some innovative systems, to         produce a design
that's nostalgic, yet fun.

What make Battle Planes different?  Design principles: (1) Short games         aide
replayability and reduce burnout (2) Bias for action means big         damage and low
durability leads to faster-paced gameplay (3) MOBA design         principles focus more on
action and less on grinding (4) Fresh means not         being afraid to do things new-and-
improved (5) Classic battleships is a         competitive and brilliant game - when in
doubt, remain unbroken.

The western nations and eastern faction have long been allies and shared
knowledge, as well as technology; but the recent discovery of numerous,         rich
resource deposits near an unnamed gorge has resulted in a bitter         standoff.
Secure your team's victory in one final cacophony of helicopters,         explosives, and
other armament.

This map was previously titled "The Gorge".

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>A fancy little model I mode. I made the mesh except for the spinning rotor blades, geries made those and I then gave it gyrocopter anims. Geries then made the rotorblades spin and helped me with spinning the miniguns during its attack animation.<br />
<br />
I spent me roughly 11 days making this, and on the final day when geries helped me, we managed to get most things working. However, if you got any critiques, ideas, bugs you name it, point it out and I&#039;ll fix it ASAP.<br />
<br />
I wasn&#039;t planning on releasing this model until my map was done, but meh, you&#039;ll get this one a little earlier just because. This is the summon for the Goblin Rifleman on my map.<br />
<br />
Anyhow, Enjoy.<br />
<br />
Since some have issues with credits. I will summarize them.<br />
MiniMage -&gt; 99% Mesh.<br />
Geries -&gt; 1% Mesh, Helped with animations.<br />
<br />
The model was heavily inspired by this picture.<br />

<br />
Please note, the death animation references the neutral death explosion. For added effect, download this model. http://www.hiveworkshop.com/forums/models-530/ultimate-explosion-air-based-explosion-48748/?prev=search%3Dexplosion%26d%3Dlist%26r%3D20<br />
<br />
Then change the filepath of that explosion to<br />
&quot;Objects\Spawnmodels\Other\NeutralBuildingExplosion\NeutralBuildingExplosion.mdx&quot;<br />
<br />
I would also suggest that you have about the height of the Gryphon Rider. That is to ensure that the death anim looks good. With that height, it looks like my model spins down and explodes on the ground or at the very least, close to it. ;P<br />
<br />
<b>Edit</b>:Geries tweaked some animations for me and I removed some unnessary attachment points as suggested.<br />

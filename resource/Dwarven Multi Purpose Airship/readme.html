<h2>Description</h2>
<p><i>A speedy, unmanned airship just recently brought into service by the Dwarven Air Force. Armed with a D35 Artillery Improv and a stockpile of FrenchClaw missiles, this new model already shows promise, both as an air superiority fighter, and as a powerful reconnaissance machine.</i><br />
<br />
Hmm.. Another Scratch Made model, created using Milkshape 3d and Magos&#039; Model Editor. This one took me about 5 hours of work over 2 days.<br />
<br />
In this download, You&#039;ll get models of both the Airship, and the Missiles it uses in it&#039;s Attack Slam animation. The missile model is not recommended for the normal attack of the model.<br />

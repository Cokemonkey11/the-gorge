INTRODUCTION = (

    """

        The Gorge is a battleships-style AoS/MOBA that focuses on simplicity.
        It uses automatically firing weapons, and some innovative systems, to
        produce a design that's nostalgic, yet fun.

    """,

    """

        What make The Gorge different?  Design principles: (1) Short games aide
        replayability and reduce burnout (2) Bias for action means big damage
        and low durability leads to faster-paced gameplay (3) MOBA design
        principles focus more on action and less on grinding (4) Fresh means not
        being afraid to do things new-and-improved (5) Classic battleships is a
        competitive and brilliant game - when in doubt, remain unbroken.

    """,

    """

        The western nations and eastern faction have long been allies and shared
        knowledge, as well as technology; but the recent discovery of numerous,
        rich resource deposits near an unnamed gorge has resulted in a bitter
        standoff.
        Secure your team's victory in one final cacophony of helicopters,
        explosives, and other armament.
